# BioData
An Arduino library for interpreting biological signals, BioData makes it easier to collect data relative to photoplethysmograph (heart sensor), including normalizing the signal, obtaining BPM, and heartbeat.

# BASIC SETUP

Code verified on Arduino 1.8.1 

https://www.arduino.cc/

on a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller

https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/

If you haven't already, you will need to install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) in order to run this program on a Teensy as well.

Alternatively, you should be able to run this code on most Arduino-friendly microcontrollers

To gather __pulse data__ I use the [Pulse Sensor](https://pulsesensor.com/)
